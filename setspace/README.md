# setspace
## control line spacing in latex documents

The code is unchanged from Geoffrey
Tobin's LaTeX 2.09 original, except for patches that avoid a problem
with \@setsize, when the package is used with other 2.09 packages
under LaTeX 2e, and updates to match updates in the original LaTeX
definitions.
