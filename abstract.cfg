%从这里开始写你的摘要，分段需要空一行。
TeX 是高德纳（Donald Ervin Knuth，1938年1月10日 --）教授愤世嫉俗追求完美做出来的排版引擎，同时也是该引擎使用的标记语言（Markup Language）的名称。这里所谓的引擎，是指能够实现断行、分页等操作的程序（请注意这并不是定义）；这里的标记语言，是指一种将控制命令和文本结合起来的格式，它的主体是其中的文本而控制命令则实现一些特殊效果（同样请注意这并不是定义）。

而 LaTeX 则是 L. Lamport （1941年2月7日 -- ） 教授开发的基于 TeX 的排版系统。实际上 LaTeX 利用 TeX 的控制命令，定义了许多新的控制命令并封装成一个可执行文件。这个可执行文件会去解释 LaTeX 新定义的命令成为 TeX 的控制命令，并最终交由 TeX 引擎进行排版。

为了解决这个问题，Hàn Thế Thành 博士在他的博士论文中提出了 pdfTeX 这个对 TeX 引擎的扩展。二者最主要的差别就是 pdfTeX 直接输出 pdf 格式文档，而 TeX 引擎则输出 dvi 格式的文档。

% ABSTRACT
\def\abstracten{
%Your abstract here, to make a new paragraph, give an extra blank line please.
At one point, the officers can be heard telling one another that they thought Mr Nichols was "on something" - seeming to indicate that they believed he had been using drugs. There is no known evidence that this was the case.Once the officer's bodycam is back on, we get a clearer view of Mr Nichols as he is slumped against the unmarked police car.

He appears to be injured and blood is visible on his head. He does not speak. One officer pulls him up after he slumps to the side. He is variously seen sitting up, leaning on the car or slumped on the ground.

A significant portion of the video shows officers speaking to one another and recounting details of the incident. Some of the officers claim that Mr Nichols "swung" at them or reached for their guns. Neither allegation is supported by the released video.

Another officer later claims Mr Nichols swerved and almost struck his police vehicle. Officers can also be heard discussing the fact that nothing was found in his car.
